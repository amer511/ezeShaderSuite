\section {linear}
\subsubsection {on/off}
check this on when working in linear space \\
\smallskip
\\
NOTE!: it is recommended to linearize the textures before hand using tdlmake. You using tdl files? Why not linearizing the texture when converting them? Refer to 3delight help on “why not!” using this setting.

%-------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection {gamma}
If working In linear space and want to linearize your textures at render time, you can set this to 0.454. But you've been warned not to.

\smallskip

%-------------------------------------------------------------
\section {diffuse}

\begin{picture}(0,290)
\put(0,0){\includegraphics[scale=.42]{shadersDocumentationImages/ezeHairDiffuse.jpg}}
\label{pic:ezeHairDiffuse}
\end{picture}

\noindent In Figure~{\ref{pic:ezeHairDiffuse}}, ezeHair shader AOV\_hair\_diffuse, with a high value wrapIllum Angle (notice the back lighted hair on the back of the neck) and ezeEnvironment. 
Note: Diffuse AOV contains the contribution from all direct lights and ezeEnvironment/ezeIndirect

\subsubsection {Kd}
Kd is a diffuse lighting multiplier. This will of course affect all kind of lighting, except if using the Ambient override to use a prebaked map for fur.
\smallskip
\subsubsection {Ki}
is the indirect diffuse lighting multiplier (any light contributing to the indirectDiffuse ie ezeIndirect).
Keep in mind There is also global multiplier on the ezeIndirect shader.
\smallskip
\subsubsection {Ka}
Ka is an ambient multiplier
\smallskip
\subsubsection {Illum Wrap Angle }
Illum Wrap Angle refers to the light wrapping angle of the light on the hair strand as a cylinder. The bigger the angle the more illumination it will show from side and back lights
\smallskip
\subsubsection {Tip and root Colors, multipliers, controls and masks}
You can use tip and root colors by themselves. When adding a map, the map will be multiplied by the tip and root colors according with the root and tip position. 
The position will control the ramp start and end points for the texture tip and root blend, saying that the hair strand root is 0 and the tip is 1.\\
If you want to use shaves root/tip colors,leave the maps blank, the colors to white, and check the export root/tip colors in your Shave Globals node.

\noindent In Figure~{\ref{pic:ezeHairDarkening.jpg}}, ezeHair shader parameters.

%-------------------------------------------------------------
\section {ambient}
\subsubsection {Ambient tip root controls}
Control the ambient light fake for the tip and root using tipAmbientLightColor and rootAmbientLightColor.
\smallskip
\subsubsection {Tip root Ambient Control maps}
If you want to avoid calculating occlusion on the fly or basically want to have different ambient values, you specify a map in here, and you will get the full control over tip bright/dark colors and root bright/dark colors according to the map!
An extra color multiplier for the tip and the root with ramp start/end points control that can be mask with a image.

\begin{picture}(0,255)
\put(0,0){\includegraphics[scale=.5]{shadersDocumentationImages/ezeHairAmbientMaps.jpg}}
\label{pic:ezeHairAmbientMaps}
\end{picture}

\noindent In Figure~{\ref{pic:ezeHairAmbientMaps}}, ezeHair fake ambient Map coloring.

\smallskip
\subsubsection {ambientGamma}
Use this parameter to control the gamma of the texture Mask.\\
The actual blended colors will retain the gamma value from the diffuse tab.

\smallskip
\subsubsection {darkening controls and darkening masks}
Controls the root and tip darkening, start/end points of the darkening and an optional mask map for the effect.
\\

\subsubsection {ambientOccludeEnvLights}
If On, ezeEnvironment light will skip occlusion calculation and use the ambient map instead to occlude the sampled environment map.
This is handy to speed up renders by skipping occlusion on the hair, or to fake the occlusion with a baked map but with some drawbacks \& limitations, see below\\


\begin{picture}(150,130)
\put(0,0){\includegraphics[scale=.5]{shadersDocumentationImages/ezeHairUseAmbientMapEnv.jpg}}
\label{pic:ezeHairUseAmbientMapEnv}
\end{picture}

\noindent In Figure~{\ref{pic:ezeHairUseAmbientMapEnv}}, As you can see on the comparison, the occlusion is lost on the tips as the Ambient map here was  calculated  from the geometry. A quick fix for this would be to bake the hair occlusion as described on Pixars paper on Ratatouille.

\smallskip
\subsubsection {primary specular roughness}
controls the specular roughness
\smallskip
\subsubsection {primary specular Color}
color for the specular (map slot coming soon)
\smallskip
\subsubsection {primary shift}
shifts the specular along the heir lenght
\smallskip
\subsubsection {Using Specular Shifts Maps}
Use the provided map for this parameter.\\
This map is included in the maya scene samples texture/ folder.
\smallskip
%-------------------------------------------------------------
\section {alpha}
Either you overriding the Oi, using shaves root/tip transparency, or using a map remember to check Use Surface Shaders in shadow pass!\\
Note:ezeShaders will skip any lighting/sss calculation while not in "finalRenderPass".\\
If you are using any other shaders you might need to use a shaderCollection override for the shadow pass to avoid unnecessary calculations.
\subsubsection {Overriding shave Surface Oi}
You can either use shaves opacity (remember to check tip Fade and export opacity at the shaveShape and shaveGlobals), or override it with the controls under this tab.
\subsubsection {alphaMap}
this map will multiply the opacity values wether you use the Oi or the alpha override parameters.\\

\smallskip
%-------------------------------------------------------------
\section {sss}
For SSS to work under 3delight, attach a geometryAttr node to the hair and add the sss attributes and specify a group.
The same group should be specified in the shader.\\
Recommended parameters for the sss attributes:\\
-Hair does not need dicing, you can add a shading rate multiplier and set it to 20 and add a DiceHair attribute and check it on.\\
-If you are baking the hair on a separate pass to a ptc to later read, you can scale the dice size to get a smoother look (ezeBake shader includes this parameter!)
\subsubsection {maps}
\textbf{Cutout:} This map will control where to skip sss calculation. This will speed up your renders quite a lot by isolating the calculation of the effect. Pure black means skip (check the threshold parameter).
It is recommended to use the color map IF using a color map, and theres no need for a custom cutout map (Still not implemented)\\
\textbf{cutout Threshold}:\\
Use to set the threshold for the sss skip.\\
\textbf{color:} Multiplier for the sss color\\
\smallskip
%-------------------------------------------------------------
\section {AOVs}
If you plan to use a composition software as Nuke to make your final image, you might want to take advantage of the fact that the multipliers for each effect are not taken into account on the aovs outputs.
For ie: Setting the translucence multiplier to 0.01, it will make it virtually invisible on the final render, but the aov will contain the proper values as calculated in the shader prior to the multiplication.
\subsection {output to standard aovs}
This option will make the shader to output the aovs ALSO to the standard ones (this applies to the ezeSurface
Shader).
\subsection {aov listing}
output varying color aov\_hair\_diffuse\\
output varying color aov\_hair\_indirect\\
output varying color aov\_hair\_totalscatter\\

output varying color aov\_hair\_secondaryspecular\\
output varying color aov\_hair\_subsurface\\
output varying color aov\_hair\_v\\
output varying color aov\_indirect\\
\smallskip

\noindent if output to standard aovs is checked, the shader will also contribute to the common ezeSurface aovs\\
\\
    output varying color aov\_specular = aov\_hair\_totalSpecular\\
    output varying color aov\_diffuse = aov\_hair\_diffuse\\ 
    output varying color aov\_ambient = aov\_hair\_ambient\\
    output varying color aov\_surfaceColor = aov\_hair\_surfaceColor\\
    output varying color aov\_subsurface = aov\_hair\_subsurface\\
    output varying color aov\_indirect = aov\_hair\_indirect\\

\section {diffuse}

Passes configuration


\subsubsection {fullPassName}
This parameter is for specifying the pass name in which the beauty render takes place.
In this particular pass everything is calculated and sampled. If not in this pass the subsurface, specular, indirect, and occlusion contributions are skipped (not needed for occlusion, or indirect lighting when baking ptc/bkm, etc.)\\
For skipping occlusion/indirect lights It specifically skips the one belonging to \_cat: envLight.\\
\subsubsection {bakePassName}
In this section you can specify the bake pass and the target ptc file to avoid using a shader collection override on the objects at the bake pass.
Use the same ptc file in several shaders and they will all concurrently write the information to the file.
You can also leave this passName parameter blank nd use ezeBake in your bake pass instead.
\smallskip
\subsubsection {Kd}
diffuse lighting multiplier 
\smallskip
\subsubsection {Ki}
the indirect diffuse lighting multiplier any light contributing to the indirectDiffuse\_AOV, ie ezeIndirect.
Theres also a multiplier in ezeIndirectShader
\smallskip
\subsubsection {Ka}
ambient value (independent from the ambientLights on the scene
\smallskip
\subsubsection {KdColor}
diffuse color to use if the map is not specified. If there is a map, the map will be multiplied by this color.
\smallskip
\subsubsection {diffuse}
color map
\smallskip
\subsubsection {Gamma }
Gamma for the diffuse map and the KdColor
If working In linear space and want to linearize your textures at render time, you can set this to 0.454.\\
NOTE!: it is recommended to linearize the textures before hand using tdlmake. You using tdl files? Why not linearizing the texture when converting them?
Refer to 3delight help on “why not!” using this setting.

This parameter is used for masking specular highlights with a map. 
The map is projected in 3d space from the light incident vector onto the surface to mask its specular contribution.\\\\
For further control ezeUber light shader has a specular mask contribution slider to attenuate or disable this effect on any light.

\subsubsection {cutout Threshold}
Use to set the threshold for the sss skip. This value compared against the texture value or the sss color if not texture is used. \\

\section {displace}

Using shave on a displaced geometry? You can easily copy the values from your shave displacement alphaGain and offset map here and it should match!!!

\subsubsection {displacement}
Overall displacement multiplier (usually you would leave this value at 1)
\smallskip
\subsubsection {textureName}
Displacement texture file
\smallskip
\subsubsection {offset}
Here you would usually put your displacement $-\frac{worldSpaceValue}{2}$
\smallskip
\subsubsection {multiplier}

\smallskip
\\
\\
Note: refer to your sculpting software manual on how to get the displacement worldSpaceValue


\chapter{ezehairDisplacement}

To avoid shaves displacement map, and be able to use them also with maya Fur and Yeti this shader will be available soon!

\section {hairDisplace (soon)}

Although not recommend for obvious reasons, this shader might be handy for matching exactly the hair underlying geometry displacement.It has the same attributes as the common displace, but this one will displace the hair geometry on N\_Srf and only update N\_Srf, not N.
Beware of using just the right amount of displacement bound to avoid a render overkill!

\subsubsection {displacement}

\end{picture}

\noindent In Figure~{\ref{pic:ezeUbberParameters}}, ezeHair shader parameters


\section {Basic}
\subsubsection {lighttype}
one of "spot", "omni", or "arealight".  Spot lights are  those that point in a particular direction (+z in local light  space, for this light.  Omni lights throw light in all directions.  Area lights are emitted from actual geometry (this only works on BMRT area lights for the time being).\\
\\
NOTE: when using spot type, mayas coneAngle value is discarded and width height parameters in the shader are used instead!\\
\\
NOTE2: if a shadow map is to be used, you need to point to the map (see shadow Mapped subsection), add a attributes node to the light with shadow Maps attributes.\\
See maya tips for tokens or refer to the 3delight docs for a full list of tokens.
\smallskip
\subsubsection {exposure}
overall intensity scaling of the light
\smallskip
\subsubsection {lightcolor}
overall color filtering for the light
\smallskip

%-------------------------------------------------------------
\section {Zshaping and Distance fallOff}
\subsubsection {cuton, cutoff }
define the depth range (z range from the origin, in   light coordinates) over which the light is active.  Outside  this range, no energy is transmitted.
\smallskip
%-------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection {nearedge, faredge}
define the width of the transition regions   for the cuton and cutoff.  The transitions will be smooth.
\smallskip
%-------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection {falloff }
defines the exponent for falloff.  A falloff of 0 (the  default) indicates that the light is the same brightnessregardless of distance from the source.\\
Falloff==1 indicates  linear (1\/r) falloff\\
falloff==2 indicates 1/r\^2 falloff  (which is physically correct for point-like sources, but  sometimes hard to use)
\smallskip
\subsubsection {falloffdist}
the distance at which the incident energy is actually  equal to intensity*lightcolor.\\
 In other words, the intensity  is actually given by:   I = (falloffdist / distance) \^\\ falloff
\smallskip
\subsubsection {maxintensity}
to prevent the light from becoming unboundedly  large when the distance < falloffdist, the intensity is  smoothly clamped to this maximum value.
\smallskip
\subsubsection {parallelrays }
when 0 (the default), the light appears to eminate  from a single point (i.e. the rays diverge).  When nonzero,  the light rays are parallel, as if from an infinitely distant  source (like the sun).
\smallskip

%-------------------------------------------------------------
\section {Zy Shaping}
Shaping of the cross-section.  The cross-section of the light cone is actually described by a superellipse with the following controls:
\subsubsection {shearx, sheary}
define the amount of shear applied to the light  cone direction.  Default is 0, meaning that the center of the  light cone is aligned with the z axis in local light space
\smallskip
\subsubsection {width, height}
define the amount of shear applied to the light  cone direction.  Default is 0, meaning that the center of the  light cone is aligned with the z axis in local light space
\smallskip
\subsubsection {wedge, hedge}
the amount of width and height edge fuzz,  respectively.  Values of 0 will make a sharp cutoff, larger  values (up to 1) will make the edge softer.
\smallskip
\subsubsection {roundness}
controls how rounded the corners of the superellipse  are.  If this value is 0, the cross-section will be a perfect  rectangle.  If the value is 1, the cross-section will be a  perfect circle.  In between values control the roundness of  the corners in a fairly obvious way.
\smallskip
\subsubsection {beamdistribution }
controls intensity falloff due to angle.  A value of 0 (the default) means no angle falloff.  A value of 1 is roughly physically correct for a spotlight, and  corresponds to a cosine falloff.  For a BMRT area light, the cosine falloff happens automatically, so 0 is the right physical  value to use.  In either case, you may use larger values to  make the spot more bright in the center than the outskirts.  This parameter has no effect for omni lights.
\\
Note:When using this parameter with a hair backLight,no matter the wrapIllum Angle of the ezeHair diffuse, It will draw the light useless! 
\smallskip

%-------------------------------------------------------------
\section {gobo}
Cookie or slide filter
\subsubsection {slidename}
if a filename is supplied, a texture lookup will be  done and the light emitted from the source will be filtered  by that color, much like a slide projector.  If you want to  make a texture map that simply blocks light, just make it  black-and-white, but store it as a RGB texture.  For  simplicity, the shader assumes that the texture file will  have at least three channels.
\smallskip
%-------------------------------------------------------------
\section {Noise}
\subsubsection {Projected noise on the light}
\smallskip
%-------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection {noiseamp}
amplitude of the noise.  A value of 0 (the default)  means not to use noise.  Larger values increase the blotchiness  of the projected noise
\smallskip
%-------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection {noisefreq }
frequency of the noise.
\smallskip
%-------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection {noiseoffset }
spatial offset of the noise.  This can be animated,  for example if you are using the noise to simulate the attenuation of light as it passes through a window with  water drops dripping down it.
\smallskip
%-------------------------------------------------------------
\section {Shadow Mapped}
shadows are mainly computed by shadow maps.  Please consult the PRMan documentation for more information on the meanings of these parameters
\subsubsection {shadowmap }
the name of the texture containing the shadow map.  If  this value is "" (the default), no shadow map will be used. 
\smallskip
%-------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection {shadowblur  }
how soft to make the shadow edge, expressed as a  percentage of the width of the entire shadow map.
\smallskip
%-------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection {shadowbias  }
the amount of shadow bias to add to the lookup.
\smallskip
%-------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection {shadownsamps  }
the number of samples to use.
\smallskip
%-------------------------------------------------------------
\section {RayTraced}
These options work only for BMRT:   raytraceshadow - if nonzero, cast a ray to see if we are in shadow.  The default is zero, i.e. not to try raytracing.
\subsubsection {Ray-traced shadows}
check this on when working in linear space 
\smallskip
%-------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection {shadowcheat}
add this offset to the light source position.  This  allows you to cause the shadows to eminate as if the light  were someplace else, but without changing the area  illuminated or the appearance of highlights, etc.
\smallskip
%-------------------------------------------------------------
\section {fake Blocker Shadow}
"Fake" shadows from a blocker object.  A blocker is a superellipse in 3-space which effectively blocks light.  But it's not really geometry, the shader just does the intersection with the superellipse.  The blocker is defined to lie on the x-y plane of its own coordinate system (which obviously needs to be defined in the RIB file using the CoordinateSystem command).
\subsubsection {blockercoords}
the name of the coordinate system that defines the  local coordinates of the blocker.  If this is "", it indicates  that the shader should not use a blocker at all.
\smallskip
\subsubsection {blockerwidth, blockerheight }
define the dimensions of the blocker's  superellipse shape.
\smallskip
\subsubsection {blockerwedge, blockerhedge }
define the fuzzyness of the edges.
\smallskip
\subsubsection {blockerround}
how round the corners of the blocker are (same  control as the "roundness" parameter that affects the light  cone shape.
\smallskip
%-------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection {shadowcolor }
Shadows (i.e. those regions with "occlusion" as  defined by any or all of the shadow map, ray cast, or  blocker) don't actually have to block light.  In fact, in  this shader, shadowed regions actually just change the color  of the light to "shadowcolor".  If this color is set to  (0,0,0), it effectively blocks all light.\\
But if you set it  to, say (.25,.25,.25), it will make the shadowed regions lose  their full brightness, but not go completely dark.  Another  use is if you are simulating sunlight: set the lightcolor to  something yellowish, and make the shadowcolor dark but  somewhat bluish.  Another effect of shadows is to set the  \_\_nonspecular flag, so that the shadowed regions are lit only  diffusely, without highlights.
\smallskip
%-------------------------------------------------------------
\section {Contribution controls}
Allows you to control the effect amount a light will have on the shader.\\
0 means full amount, 0.2 = 80\%, 0.9 = 10\%, 1 = None, 
\subsubsection {\_\_nonspecular }
when set to 1, this light does not create  specular highlights!  The default is 0, which means it makes highlights just fine (except for regions in shadows, as  explained above).  This is very handy for lights that are meant to be fill lights, rather than key lights.  NOTE: This depends on the surface shader looking for, and correctly acting upon, this parameter.  The builtin functions  diffuse(), specular() and phong() all do this, for PRMan 3.5  and later, as well as BMRT 2.3.5 and later.  But if you write  your own illuminance loops in your surface shader, you've got  to account for it yourself The PRMan user manual explains how  to do this.
\smallskip
\subsubsection {\_\_nondiffuse }
the analog to \_\_nonspecular, if this flag is set to  1, this light will only cast specular highlights, but not  diffuse light.  This is useful for making a light that only  makes specular highlights, without affecting the rest of the  illumination in the scene.  All the same caveats apply with  respect to the surface shader, as described above for \_\_nonspecular
\smallskip

\subsubsection {\_\_nonScatter}
scatter Effects, works for both ezeSurface and ezeHair
\smallskip

\subsubsection {\_\_nonTransluncence}
only used in ezeHair
\smallskip

\subsubsection {\_\_nonSubsurface}
subSurface effect, works for both ezeSurface and ezeHair
\smallskip

\subsubsection {\_\_nonSpecularMask}
blends the specular masks, any value between 0-1 will have an effect on the mask transparency.
See ezeSurface Specular masks section for more information on this
\smallskip

\subsubsection {\_\_foglight  }
the "noisysmoke" shader distributed with BMRT will add  atmospheric scattering only for those lights that have this  parameter set to 1 (the default).  In other words, if you use  this light with noisysmoke, you can set this flag to 0 to  make a particular light *not* cause illumination in the fog.  Note that the noisysmoke shader is distributed with BMRT, but  will also work just fine with PRMan (3.7 or later).
